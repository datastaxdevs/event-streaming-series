# Week III Pulsar in Action

In this episode, we will not only start to code an event streaming platform but will go on to build a fully integrated solution. We will discuss integration patterns with Apache Pulsar and how to deploy a Pulsar end-to-end solution integrated with Cassandra and ElasticSearch and a 3rd party REST API - we will perform data modifications in the data pipeline and send it to another system. We will also discuss different ways of connecting Pulsar to systems using Pulsar IO connector and pulsar functions. We will finish up by showing you options for deploying and monitoring your system, and will take Astra Streaming for a spin!
